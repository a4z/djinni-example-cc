for generator, 
--pycffi-package-name PyCFFIlib
PyCFFIlib is hardcoded everywhere, 
support lib, generator, ....
so that is ... not good,  to have an option and have that hardcoded

ergo, also the pip is not usable atm

this needs to be fixed, since having just 1 lib with a given name .... 

also, the wrapper_marshal header needs to be available for running pycffi 
if it comes via conan , bad luck since that makes it difficult 


support_lib_root=$(conan info --profile default -o djinni-support-lib:with_jni=True -o djinni-support-lib:with_objc=True -o djinni-support-lib:with_python=True --path djinni-support-lib/1.2.0@ -j | gojq -r '.[] | .package_folder')

to get the path to the include folder .... 

which users can/will do that ? 


so, the whole pip code should be generated
and maybe even the wrapper_marshal.h ? 

I have no idea how to make that all user friendly ....
